# modal-project

Technicals used:
In this modal class is done using JS mainly for logic building.
I have used HTML for structure and the clickeble buttons.
I have used CSS for styling and for perfect representation of the project.

USES:
Basically,
THis project is done by manupulating class and providing info to the user,We can exit this page by clicking outside of the box,By clicking ESC key in keyboard or using exit button on right corner.
This mainly helped me to build logical knowledge.

Happy Coding ðŸ™‚.
